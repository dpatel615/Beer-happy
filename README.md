# Beer-happy

## General
 The start of the pandemic brought about many changes to the food service industry. Among those changes is the increase in "home-brew" mixologists! To help handle the sudden growth and interest in mocktails and cocktails, we introduce Beer Happy! Beer Happy is an app designed for the home-brew mixologist with an easy to use interface that allows users to research any drink they'd like to try making, and save ones they enjoy to their profile! Our five-star rating system allows users to see which cocktails are the most popular.
